#ToDo List

##Objectives

* Build a todo list using vanilla JS
* Use best practices when writing code

This week we have been learning about writing functions, working with loops, and writing conditionals. We also learned about HTML, CSS, and the DOM.

We will be making a todo list page using all of these concepts.

##Getting Started

* Create a new repository for your code, name it whatever you want
* Create your starter files in your repo, e.g. index.html, style.css, script.js

##Requirements
* The todo list should use a form to add new items
* The form should have a "submit" event listener
* Custom styles

**Have Fun** - The best way to learn is by playing with code. Let creativity guide you and try some experiments with JS and CSS and see what you can do.

##Bonuses

* Add functionality for deleting items (create a delete button for each item as it gets added)
* Research the "strikethrough" css style to be able to check off items
